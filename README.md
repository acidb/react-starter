This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This is a starter template for Mobiscroll (https://mobiscroll.com)

The Mobiscroll CLI will take care of cloning and installing the necessary plugins and tools for this starter. 
If you don't have it installed, please go to https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mobiscroll/cli

Open a terminal window (command prompt) and run the following commands:

$ mobiscroll start react 

$ npm start

This (npm start) will run the ionic project in browser. For testing the app on a device or emulator run:

$ ionic cordova platform add ios
$ ionic cordova run ios

You can do the same for Android by substituting ios for android.

Feel free to reach out on https://mobiscroll.com if there is any trouble.
